LEM — Large Emotional Model

A separate emotional processing system that runs alongside the LLM.
The LLM thinks. The LEM feels. They are connected but independent.

Usage:
    from lem import LEMEngine

    engine = LEMEngine()
    result = engine.process_interaction("How are you feeling?", source="human")
    print(engine.get_bridge_output())
